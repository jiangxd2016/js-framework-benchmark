Because of the heavy amount of Rust dependencies, this example is pre-compiled, so you don't need to compile anything.

However, if you do want to compile it, you will need the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)

After installing those, run these commands:

```sh
npm install
npm run build-prod-force
```
